# VALORANT Clip Tracker

An app to keep track of all your sick VAL plays.

TODO:

- Add auth using next-auth for users to login
- Check if there is a way to fetch weapons + maps from VAL API
- Figure out mappings for weapons/maps...do we want to store these somewhere globally on the app?
- Implement search functionality
- Add Agents
- Edge cases (i.e. requested user doesn't exist, etc.)
- Lazy loading clips on client
- Fix TS errors (remove // @ts-nocheck)
