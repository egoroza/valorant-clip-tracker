# VALORANT Clip Tracker

An app to keep track of all your sick VAL plays!

TODO:

- Add auth using next-auth for users to login (maybe...)
- Check if there is a way to fetch weapons + maps from VAL API
- Add Agents
- Edge cases (i.e. requested user doesn't exist, etc.)
- Lazy loading clips on client
- Fix TS errors (remove // @ts-nocheck)
- Make responsive / mobile friendly
- Images for weapons + maps, user image
- Filter overall by weapon or map (instead of just by user)
